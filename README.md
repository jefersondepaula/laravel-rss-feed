## Considerations

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [MVC framework to construct a simple application which
will connect to an RSS feed of your choosing,](https://laravel.com/docs/).
- The application should read
the [feeds](http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/england/rss.xml) from the database and output them in a suitable UI.
- native JavaScript snippet to be created which will listen out for a click on a feed
